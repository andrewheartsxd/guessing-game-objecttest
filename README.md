This is a separate version of the project I started from scrtach to try encapsulating all the properties of my dice in a dice object.

This is also where the updating dice images were succesfully implemented, which is then used in the official submission. In addition, this version shows the final roll count and balance on the HTML, while the final version does not (bug to be fixed)
